It's likely I'll be adding quite a lot of stuff to "PivotTables".

Tues 03 Feb 2026: I uploaded the file PivotTablesVBA_01.bas which contains the procedures:

  PTs__CachesCountActiveWB
  ![PTs__CachesCountActiveWB.png](images/PTs__CachesCountActiveWB.png)

  PTs_CacheRecycle
  ![PTs_CacheRecycle.png](images/PTs_CacheRecycle.png)

  PTs_CountEachTab

Also:

  PTs_SelectPTIncFilters & PTs_SelectPTExcFilters which do exactly what you would expect.
