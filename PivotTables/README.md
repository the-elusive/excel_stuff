It's likely I'll be adding quite a lot of stuff to "PivotTables".

Tues 03 Feb 2026: I uploaded the file PivotTablesVBA_01.bas which contains the procedures:

&nbsp;PTs__CachesCountActiveWB</br>
  ![PTs__CachesCountActiveWB.png](images/PTs__CachesCountActiveWB.png)

  PTs_CacheRecycle</br>

  PTs_CountEachTab</br>

Also:

  PTs_SelectPTIncFilters & PTs_SelectPTExcFilters which do exactly what you would expect.
