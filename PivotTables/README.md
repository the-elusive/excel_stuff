### It's likely I'll be adding quite a lot of stuff to "PivotTables".

Tues 03 Feb 2026: I uploaded the file PivotTablesVBA_01.bas which contains the procedures:

&nbsp;&nbsp;PTs__CachesCountActiveWB</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;![PTs__CachesCountActiveWB.png](images/PTs__CachesCountActiveWB.png)

&nbsp;&nbsp;PTs_CacheRecycle</br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;PTs_CountEachTab</br>

Also:

&nbsp;&nbsp;**PTs_SelectPTIncFilters** & **PTs_SelectPTExcFilters** which do exactly what you would expect.
